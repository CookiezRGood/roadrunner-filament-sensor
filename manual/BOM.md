Notes: 
1. It's possible to use the shaft of the large plastic gear that comes with the BMG extruder kit instead of purchasing a separate 5mm smooth rod. Simply remove the plastic part of the gear and ensure the shaft fits in the bearings, this may require some grinding.
2. The linked AS5600 breakout board comes with a 3mm diameter magnet. If you must purchase a magnet separately, make sure it has its poles oriented across its diameter, not across the thickness.
3. The IR sensor does not require any of the usual MK3S hardware although many kits on Aliexpress are sold with the extra hardware. Only the small screw to attach the PCB and the PCB itself are needed for the build.
